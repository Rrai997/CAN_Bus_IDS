# CAN Bus Intrusion Detection Leveraging Deep Learning for Enhanced Vehicle Security
 - Our methodology used the car hacking dataset, survival analysis dataset, and the OTIDS dataset. 
 - We combined all three datasets into one single dataset to address all the possible intrusions affecting the CAN bus network.
 - We employed RNN variants: LSTM, GRU, Bi-directional LSTM, and VGG-16 model for the classification
 - We have released the combined dataset as well the dataset images generated by VGG-16 architecture.
 - The release contains data for both binary as well as multiclass classification purpose.
